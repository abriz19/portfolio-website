## Overview

The **Job Board Platform** enables companies to post jobs, manage applicants, and customize admin roles with specific permissions. The platform leverages **microservices** for scalable handling of different services such as job management, user management, and application tracking. The **Kafka** event-driven system ensures real-time synchronization across these services, making the platform highly responsive to user actions.

## Key Features

- **Job Listings**: Companies can post job openings with detailed descriptions and requirements.
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Administrators can define custom roles and permissions for job posting and applicant management.
- **Applicant Management**: Users can apply for jobs, and companies can track applicants through their profile and application status.
- **Real-Time Notifications**: Admins and applicants are notified in real-time regarding job postings, application status, and any updates.
- **Microservices Architecture**: Modular design for easy scalability, with different services managing jobs, users, and applications independently.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: For backend services and API integration.
- **PostgreSQL**: For database management and storage of job listings, applications, and user profiles.
- **Kafka**: For event-driven communication between job and user management services.
- **JWT Authentication**: For secure login and authorization of users and admins.
- **React & Next.js**: For building the frontend user interface with a clean, responsive design.

## Challenges and Learnings

The primary challenge involved managing complex relationships between jobs, applicants, and admin roles. Ensuring that the system could handle a large volume of job postings and applications in real-time was another hurdle. Additionally, integrating role-based access control and ensuring the right permissions were applied to the right users required careful planning.

## Outcome

The **Job Board Platform** has enabled efficient job posting, application management, and user access control, making it a versatile and scalable solution for businesses and applicants alike. The platformâ€™s architecture ensures that it can handle growth, both in terms of user traffic and additional features in the future.
